## Group Project For Intro to Data Science
This project consited of finding a data set on kaggle.com and discove insights about the data chosen. My group decided to choose a fast food nutrition data set that consited of 
the resturant, the meal, and the meals nutritonal facts. Our aim was to discover how other macros correlate to calories, for example, does more carbs or sodium cause a greater
amount of calories. We first had to process the data, in which we also cleaned the data, and had to convert objects to floats. We then made visual to show our insights, and a 
predictive model to predict calories according to other macros. 

Provided is the data set, two jupyter notebooks, and google slides which we presented as a group.
